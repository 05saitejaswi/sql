/*Summary statistics are used to summarize a set of observations.
Everything is considered a table in SQL. One advantage of this simplification is that it's a common and visual representation that makes SQL approachable for a much wider audience.
Datasets and calculations that aren't well suited for a table representation must be converted to be used in a SQL database environment.
Aggregate functions are applied over columns of values and return a single value.
The COUNT clause can be used on any column while aggregate functions can only be used on numeric columns.
SQL supports that standard arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /).
Arithmetic between two floats returns a float.
Arithmetic between a float and an integer returns a float.
Arithmetic between two integers returns an integer.*/
